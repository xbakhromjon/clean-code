# Single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods.

# One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that
    the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good
    and write code that others can understand

# Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage,
    Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name
    of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

# Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, deletePage, or save.
    Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and preÔ¨Åxed with get,
    set, and is according to the javabean standard.

# A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.
